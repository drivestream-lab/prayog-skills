# Board seed checks (B1–B8)

| ID | Check | Blocking |
|----|-------|----------|
| B1 | Integration branch checked out; not open `chore/*-spec-*` branch | yes |
| B2 | Merged `Implementation-Plan-{initiative}.md` exists on integration branch | yes |
| B3 | §9 WorkManifest YAML parses; `epic` + `work[]` waves `W0..Wn` present | yes |
| B4 | Governance `project_board.enabled` and `name` resolved (meta read-only) | yes |
| B5 | `target.project` in §9 matches governance `project_board.name` when both set | yes |
| B6 | `gh auth status` succeeds when execution requested | yes for apply |
| B7 | EPIC exists or create plan defined; all waves parent-linked or create plan defined | yes for pass |
| B8 | All seeded issues on programme Project (`--project` or verified) | warn pilot; block later |

## Verdict

- **BLOCKED:** auth, board access, or partial seed.
- **FAIL:** missing plan, governance, or invalid §9.
