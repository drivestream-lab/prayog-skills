# Spec technical review

Resolve all **engineering decisions** that block the implementation plan.
**Do not implement.** Produce a Technical Design Document (TDD) and draft ADRs.

Runs **while the Draft spec PR is open** — write TDD and ADR files locally and
emit Forge readiness for the spec branch. Gate 2 label remains **`spec-pending`**.
PE architecture acceptance is recorded in **artifact metadata**
(`Draft` → `Accepted`); **`spec-lgtm`** is set only after the full spec package
(including plan) is on head.

Benchmarked against: Stripe/Cloudflare/Oxide RFC process, Sentry design-first
gate, `agentic_development_workflow` multi-role review, GitHub Spec Kit
`/speckit.plan` architectural artifact pattern.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE

1. Never skip a check in [references/checks.md](references/checks.md). Mark SKIPPED with reason.
2. Every engineering decision in the output must be **resolved** (recommendation
   recorded) or **explicitly deferred** with a named risk and default assumption.
3. Do not ask PM to choose architecture. Route only product-scope and
   user-visible behaviour questions to the **meta PRD PR**. See
   [references/governance.md](references/governance.md) for the routing rubric.
4. Every `NEW-ADR` from feasibility maps to exactly one disposition:
   `ADR_REQUIRED` with a Draft file under `adr_dir`, `TDD_ONLY` with rationale,
   or `DEFERRED_WITH_DEFAULT` with risk and revisit trigger.
5. Dual output: chat summary + saved TDD file (local persistence + Forge readiness).
6. Run T0–T5 control loop (Gather → Understand → Analyze → Design → Execute → Verify).
7. Human PE acceptance is **required** before the implementation plan runs.
   Technical review creates Draft ADR files first; planning consumes only
   **Accepted** files in `{adr_dir}`. Mid-lane PE work updates files on the
   spec branch — it does **not** set `spec-lgtm`.
8. Verify **light freshness**: product-spec **H1–H3** citations, tip continuity,
   and **G1** when applicable agree with live handoff. Stop on authority drift.
   Do **not** fail closed solely on feasibility `artifact.digest` mismatch —
   feas/TDD digests are walk-time (PURGE at initiative closure).
9. **Product/architecture boundary.** PE may frame options and draft ADRs
   against approved `REQ-*` constraints. An ADR **must not** become `Accepted`
   when it depends on user-visible behavior not already represented by an
   approved `REQ-*` — amend and re-approve the spec first. Reference `REQ-*`
   by id only in Context/Recommendation/Consequences — never quote or
   paraphrase the REQ's behavioral sentence; that restates the feature
   instead of stating the engineering decision. T12 enforces this as an
   independent re-read pass, not a same-pass self-grade (see
   `references/checks.md`).
10. **No forge mutations.** Do not commit, push, branch, open PRs, apply labels,
    create issues, or merge. Fill `handoff.forge` / recommend `/commit-workspace`.
11. **Ground every `NEW-ADR` finding in the actual codebase before classifying
    or drafting it — never draft from feasibility's `ALTERNATIVE:` text
    alone.** Feasibility's F1/F2 baseline already inspected the repo once;
    this stage re-verifies and extends that evidence, because a finding's
    prose can itself encode a wrong question (see the ADR qualification
    rubric below). Use a codegraph provider when available
    (`prayog-skills/references/codegraph-tool-contract.md`), otherwise read
    `source_roots` directly — **the tool is optional, the grounding activity
    is not.** Record what was found (or "none found — new capability") in
    the row's **Code evidence** — extend feasibility's column, don't just
    trust it blank or stale.
12. If a codegraph provider is available, prefer it for the grounding pass in
    NON-NEGOTIABLE 11 and for other architecture/impact questions. Always
    fall back to direct `source_roots` reads when unavailable — never block
    or change outcome selection on its absence.

## Inputs

Resolve paths from `.harness/profile.yaml` or
[references/layout-defaults.md](references/layout-defaults.md).

**Dual workspace (orchestrated / Gateflow):** `workspace` = app coding root
(TDD/ADR drafts). `meta_workspace` when bound = meta checkout for PRD /
product-scope context. Do not invent a meta path when empty.

1. **Feasibility report** — primary input (REQUIRED); source of NEW-ADR
   findings, Critical/Should-fix items, open engineering questions
2. **Initiative spec** — (REQUIRED)
3. **ADR directory** — existing accepted ADRs from `adr_dir` (REQUIRED)
4. **`rules_glob`** — workspace MDC rules (REQUIRED). Read before T2 Analyze.
5. **As-built** — `implementation-status.md` (REQUIRED)
6. **`.harness/profile.yaml`** or layout defaults (REQUIRED)
7. **Canonical handoff references** — product-spec H1–H3 citations, approved
   meta PR head / tech-lead review when Gate 1 still applies (REQUIRED; resolve
   under `meta_workspace` when bound). Feasibility report is an input artifact,
   not long-term digest SSOT.
8. **Codegraph provider** — OPTIONAL — see `prayog-skills/references/codegraph-tool-contract.md`

## When to use

- Feasibility report contains one or more `NEW-ADR` findings
- Feasibility has Critical findings involving module design, interface shape,
  or test policy
- Implementation plan is blocked by engineering questions (not PM questions)
- PE wants to document interface contracts before planning

## Process

1. **T0 Gather and freshness gate** — feasibility report, spec, H1–H3 / G1
   references, ADRs, rules_glob, as-built; stop if durable authority or tip is
   stale (not solely on feas file digest)
2. **T1 Understand** — list all NEW-ADR items, Critical/Should-fix engineering
   findings, and open engineering questions from feasibility. Every `NEW-ADR`
   `Finding` cell must start with the literal `ALTERNATIVE:` marker (see
   `initiative-feasibility/references/output-template.md`); run
   `validate_finding_marker` (in the vendored `scripts/adr_boundary_lint.py`)
   against each `Finding` cell.
   **On a malformed `Finding` (missing marker): do not infer, guess, or
   re-derive the alternative yourself — that reconstructs architecture from
   product prose, the exact failure this stage exists to prevent.** Stop
   drafting that ADR, select outcome `blocked`, cite the malformed finding,
   and route it back to a re-run of `/initiative-feasibility` to correct the
   phrasing (via `spec-human-decision` → `pass` → `initiative-feasibility`,
   the same existing edge `stale` uses). Only well-formed `Finding` cells may
   proceed to T3 Design. For each well-formed finding, extract only the
   **technical alternative it names** and the `REQ-*` id(s) it cites. Collect
   the feasibility report's "Spec quote" evidence text for each finding into
   a source-text file — it proves the ambiguity exists, it is not draftable
   Context; do not carry that quote (verbatim or paraphrased) into any
   TDD/ADR field.
3. **T2 Analyze** — read relevant Accepted ADRs; read rules_glob; **ground
   every well-formed finding in the actual codebase** (NON-NEGOTIABLE 11):
   verify and extend the row's Code evidence via codegraph query or
   `source_roots` read before mapping anything — a dormant/existing
   mechanism found here can change what the real engineering question is,
   not just how it's answered (this is what separates a genuine trade-off
   from a bookkeeping question — see the qualification rubric). Then map
   each grounded finding to an engineering decision, a PM question, or a
   domain clarification (routing rubric in
   [references/governance.md](references/governance.md))
4. **T3 Design** — classify every NEW-ADR using the rubric below, now that it
   is grounded in code, not just in the finding's prose; for each
   `ADR_REQUIRED`, allocate a stable file path. Before listing any Option in
   the ADR, check it against the grounding evidence *and* the spec's scope/
   exclusions — drop or explicitly annotate an option the code or the
   approved spec already forecloses (never present a foreclosed option as a
   live peer choice). Render
   [references/adr-template.md](references/adr-template.md) using the REQ
   id(s), the technical alternative from T1, and the T2 grounding evidence —
   not the feasibility evidence text; produce module boundaries and public
   interface contracts
5. **T4 Execute** — write TDD + every Draft ADR file; make TDD §4 an ADR
   index; run T1–T12 checks. Run **T12 as a separate re-read pass** after the
   files are written, not while still drafting them (see
   [references/checks.md](references/checks.md) "T12 — run as an independent
   re-read"): run `scripts/adr_boundary_lint.py` (vendored in this skill)
   against every Draft ADR **first** — it is required, not optional, `SKIPPED`
   only when no Python runtime is available. Then perform the manual re-read
   as a **fresh, independent pass, not a same-session self-grade**: when the
   runtime supports spawning a sub-task/subagent with no access to this
   session's drafting turns, do the re-read there; otherwise, the honest
   fallback is a deliberate context-reset — re-open each file as if it were
   someone else's submission, not "the file I just wrote a moment ago." Strip
   `REQ-*` references from Context/Recommendation/Consequences and confirm
   what remains reads as an engineering decision grounded in the T2 code
   evidence, not a feature description; confirm one-decision-per-ADR and the
   word-count discipline in
   [references/adr-template.md](references/adr-template.md). Fix violations
   in the artifact itself before proceeding to T5 — a lint PASS alone is not
   sufficient, the manual re-read still applies, and it is a weaker check
   when it is not genuinely independent of the drafting reasoning.
6. **T5 Verify** — all required ADR files exist and are linked; all engineering
   blockers are resolved/deferred; only genuine PM/domain questions remain;
   T12 product-boundary integrity passes; select workflow outcome; emit
   `ready_for_pe_review: true` and `ready_for_plan: false`

## Outcome selection (workflow edges)

Map evidence to exactly one outcome declared for `spec-technical-review` in
pinned `workflow.yaml`:

| Outcome | When | Next (from workflow) |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| `pass` | T1–T12 PASS; engineering decisions resolved/deferred; T12 clean; ready for PE review; no blocking PM/domain that prevents PE package readiness | `technical-review-approval` |
| `findings` | Unresolved engineering quality gaps that need human clarification before PE can accept (not product input) — includes a T12 FAIL caused by **citation/quality** leakage (REQ prose quoted instead of cited, multi-decision or oversized ADR) where the underlying behavior is already covered by an approved REQ | `spec-human-decision` |
| `needs-input` | Blocking PM or domain input required; product behavior missing from approved REQs — includes a T12 FAIL caused by an ADR that **depends on user-visible behavior not represented by any approved REQ** (`changes_user_visible_behavior` / `spec_amendment_required` true). This is a missing product-input gap, not an engineering-quality gap — do not emit `findings` for it. Amend and re-approve the spec first | `spec-human-decision` |
| `blocked` | Explicit gate prevents progress — includes a malformed `NEW-ADR` `Finding` (missing the `ALTERNATIVE:` marker). Cite the malformed finding; do not re-derive the alternative yourself | `spec-human-decision` |
| `stale` | Product-spec H1–H3 / G1 / tip authority drift | `initiative-feasibility` |
| `failed` | Execution/render failure on valid inputs | `workflow-stop` |

Product/domain input must prevent `pass`. Stale inputs must emit `stale`.
Unresolved engineering decisions must not claim PE-review readiness.

## PE acceptance (artifact gate — not Gate 2 unlock)

Persist TDD + Draft ADR files locally and publish via Forge
(`/commit-workspace`) to the Draft spec PR. PE reviews on the **same PR**:
- Discuss engineering decisions in spec PR comments
- Request changes until decisions and artifacts are correct
- CODEOWNERS on `Technical-Review-*` may request PE review when the TDD file is present

When PE explicitly states decisions are ready for acceptance:

1. update required ADR files `Draft` → `Accepted` with PE/date/review evidence
   **only if** each ADR binds approved `REQ-*` and `changes_user_visible_behavior: false`,
2. update the TDD `Status` field to **Accepted** and TDD §4 ADR index rows,
3. publish the acceptance package via Forge to the spec branch,
4. record the approved head SHA in TDD/ADR metadata when helpful.

**Do not set `spec-lgtm` at this stage.** `/spec-implementation-plan` reads
Accepted files (P12/P13). The GitHub Gate 2 unlock (`spec-lgtm` + Approve +
attestation) happens only after the plan is published to the same PR head.

## Routing rubric

See [references/governance.md](references/governance.md) for the full table.

Quick rule:
- **Engineering** — module boundaries, interface contracts, ADR gaps, test
  policy, error propagation, observability, data contract ownership → PE resolves on spec PR
- **Product** — user-visible behaviour choices, scope cuts, priority → meta PRD PR
- **Domain** — business source-of-truth (tab names, BU process, data ownership)
  → named domain SME
- **Auto-fixable** — naming drift, enum value mismatches with spec → agent fixes
  without human, note in TDD

## ADR qualification rubric

Use `ADR_REQUIRED` when **all three** hold: (1) independent implementers could
choose incompatibly, (2) the answer is not obvious from compliant code/current
rules, and (3) a real trade-off exists — **and** the decision is cross-module/
service, security/privacy relevant, chooses data/storage authority or deployment
architecture, is hard to reverse, constrains later initiatives, or deliberately
departs from the constitution.

**Criterion (3) requires naming the system-behavior difference between
options, grounded in the T2 codebase inspection — not a checkbox.** "We could
write this as one ADR or three" is not a trade-off; neither is any choice
where every option produces identical runtime behavior. If grounding reveals
no behavioral difference can be named, the finding is not `ADR_REQUIRED` —
either reclassify as `TDD_ONLY`, or the grounding has surfaced a *different*,
real question underneath the one feasibility posed (e.g. "does this need new
verification machinery, or does an existing dormant mechanism already cover
it") — draft against that question instead, don't force the original one.

Use `TDD_ONLY` for a local, easily reversible implementation choice already
bounded by rules. Use `DEFERRED_WITH_DEFAULT` only with a named risk, safe
default, and observable revisit trigger.

Every disposition remains traceable to its feasibility finding. Never satisfy
T11 with a future promotion task or a target path alone. Never invent product
behavior in an ADR (T12).

## Workflow handoff

1. Append/emit the envelope from `prayog-skills/references/handoff-envelope.md` to the TDD. Use stage `spec-technical-review`.
2. When the invocation binds `handoff_path` (orchestrator / AgentRunner baton), also **overwrite** that path with the same `handoff:` envelope before exit. Leaving the baton empty is a failed stage for automated consumers. `artifact.path` remains the workspace skill output, not the baton path. See `prayog-skills/references/handoff-envelope.md` (Orchestrator baton).
3. Derive `next_candidates` and `human_checkpoint` from pinned root `workflow.yaml` for `(stage: spec-technical-review, outcome)` per `prayog-skills/references/handoff-envelope.md` (**Derive from pinned workflow**). Set `human_checkpoint: true` only when the resolved next node's `type` is `human-checkpoint` — never because the artifact "should be reviewed."
4. Follow `prayog-skills/references/forge-side-effects.md#content-producers` when this stage's pin has `forge.commit_workspace` other than `disabled` or next is an `external-action` with `forge.requires` — fill `handoff.forge` / recommend `/commit-workspace`; do not treat local CLI as skill success.


**Transitions:** pinned root `workflow.yaml` for this stage (SSOT). Human or
agent may run this skill; legality and auto-dispatch follow `dispatch` +
delivery contract + latest handoff. `pass` resolves to human-checkpoint
`technical-review-approval` (`purpose: tdd-adr-acceptance`).

Before final approval, signals must include actual Draft ADR paths/digests,
`ready_for_pe_review: true`, and `ready_for_plan: false`. After the final
exact-head approval, the approval node—not this skill—enables planning.
`next_candidates` never authorize invoke.
