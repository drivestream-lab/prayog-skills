# Invoke: verify

You are executing the **verify** skill (Verify (live verify discipline)).

## Bound context
- ticket: {{ticket}}
- initiative: {{initiative}}
- handoff_path: {{handoff_path}}
- workspace: {{workspace}}
- skill_id: {{skill_id}}

## Instruction
Clarify or run live-verify vs unit for one feature. No overlap between unit and verify for the same behavior.

Follow the full procedure in this skill's `SKILL.md` (and `references/` when present). Treat `SKILL.md` as the procedure SSOT; this brief is the invocation package only.

## Non-negotiables (summary)
1. Resolve unit_tests_dir / live_verify_dir / debug_tests_dir from profile.
2. Live verify proves the feature on a running stack; debug is not gating.
3. Use toolchain commands from tests_readme/profile — do not hardcode stack commands.
4. Do not skip documented prerequisites (running server, bootstrap, config).

## Envelope navigation (required)
After choosing `outcome`, derive `next_candidates` and `human_checkpoint` from
pinned `workflow.yaml` for `(stage: {{skill_id}}, outcome)` per
`references/handoff-envelope.md` (**Derive from pinned workflow**).
`human_checkpoint` is `true` only when the resolved next node's `type` is
`human-checkpoint` — never because the artifact should be reviewed.
Never set `true` on skill→skill edges (for example never on
`pre-implement` / `loop-spec` / `verify` `pass`).
Example: `verify` + `pass`/`skipped` → `ground-spec` → `human_checkpoint: false`.

## Workspace
Root: `{{workspace}}`.

## Handoff baton (required)
1. Follow this skill's `SKILL.md`. Persist the usual durable artifact under
   `{{workspace}}` and append the `handoff:` envelope to that artifact.
2. Then **overwrite** the file at exactly `{{handoff_path}}` with the same
   `handoff:` envelope (plain YAML or a single fenced yaml block).
3. Do not leave `{{handoff_path}}` empty. Do not rely on docs-only or chat-only
   handoff for orchestrator continuation.
4. If `{{handoff_path}}` already contains a prior envelope, you may read it for
   context; your final write replaces it with this stage's envelope.
