# Implementation plan — {INITIATIVE}

## Source freshness and command contract

| Item | Value | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Spec | `{SPEC_PATH}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| Feasibility report | `{FEASIBILITY_PATH}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| Technical review | `{TECHNICAL_REVIEW_PATH}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| Impact map / revision | `{IMPACT_MAP_PATH}` / `{N}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| Repo scope digest | `sha256:{hex}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| Approved meta PR head | `{SHA}` | CURRENT / STALE |
| `check_command` | `{command}` | RESOLVED / MISSING |
| `test_command` | `{command}` | RESOLVED / MISSING |
| `verify_command` | `{live script under live_verify_dir, or N/A — reason}` | RESOLVED / N/A / MISSING |
| `ground_command` | `{command or N/A — reason}` | RESOLVED / N/A / MISSING |

> Do not continue if any source is STALE or required command is MISSING.
> `verify_command` is **live** verify (human-run at checkpoint `wave-acceptance`),
> not `{test_command}`. When P15 applies, N/A is invalid — co-ship a FILE under
> `live_verify_dir` in the same wave.
> **Technical review has no N/A path** — the pin always routes feasibility
> (`pass` or `findings`) into `/spec-technical-review` first, so a TDD file
> always exists (possibly a light-confirmation TDD with zero ADRs). A
> genuinely missing file here is `needs-input`, not an optional input; only
> the **ADR list** in §0 may legitimately read "none required".

## 0. Technical design reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Technical review | `{path to Technical-Review-{initiative}.md}` — always present; the pin routes every feasibility outcome through `/spec-technical-review` before planning. A missing file is a stale/skipped-stage condition (`needs-input`), never "N/A" |
| Technical review status | {Draft / Accepted} |
| PE sign-off | {[ ] required / [x] complete — date} |
| Resolved ADRs | {adr_dir/adr-NNN-slug.md (link, Status: Accepted), … or "none required — light confirmation, zero NEW-ADR findings" — canonical files created by `/spec-technical-review` and accepted before planning; TDD §4 index refs alone are not sufficient} |
| ADR product-boundary re-check | For every cited Accepted ADR: `changes_user_visible_behavior: false` / `spec_amendment_required: false` confirmed **and** `scripts/adr_boundary_lint.py --require-sources` re-run at plan time with sources reconstructed from the spec + feasibility report (not a bare structure-only pass) — not assumed from Accepted status or self-declared metadata alone (see P13 "lint invocation") |
| Outstanding PM questions | {list or "none — all resolved"} |
| Outstanding domain questions | {list or "none — all resolved"} |

> Do not start W0 implementation until PE sign-off is marked complete above.

## 1. Requirements (REQ) — product ids

Cite **product** `REQ-*` from the spec (same ids as PRD/spec). Do **not** invent
wave-scoped shadow ids like `REQ-W{n}`.

| ID | Summary | Spec path | Waves |
|----|---------|-----------|-------|
| REQ-01 | | {SPEC_PATH} | W0 |
| REQ-02 | | {SPEC_PATH} | W0, W1 |

---

## 2. Implementation phases

### Phase W0 — {title}

**GOAL-W0:** …

| Task | Description | Implements | Depends on | Files (path/action) | Exit criteria | Proof (kind / command\|review) | Expected | Evidence expected | Codebase | Spec path | Verify command | MDC notes | ADR notes | Branch |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| TASK-W0-01 | | REQ-01, REQ-02 | — | `src/…` create | observable result | command / `{check_command}` | exit 0 + assertion | Wave-Execution-… § TASK-W0-01 | {repo} | {SPEC_PATH} | `{check_command}` | | | |

#### Files (W0)

| ID | Path | Action |
|----|------|--------|
| FILE-W0-01 | | create / modify / delete / inspect |

#### Tests (W0)

| ID | Layer | Command | Proves |
|----|-------|---------|--------|
| TEST-W0-U | unit | (from tests_readme / profile) | REQ-* / TASK-* |
| TEST-W0-I | integration/contract | (when applicable) | REQ-* / TASK-* |
| TEST-W0-L | live (smoke\|sandbox) | `{live_verify_dir}/…` (human-run) | new/changed product surface (P15) |

#### Verification Coverage (W0)

Map every in-scope acceptance criterion / REQ for this wave to exactly one
primary layer (and note secondary layers if needed):

| REQ / criterion | unit | integration/contract | smoke | sandbox | Notes |
|-----------------|------|----------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| REQ-01 / … | TEST-W0-U | N/A | TEST-W0-L | N/A | |

#### Live-verification intent (W0)

Planning records **intent** only. Bind actual runtime head / build SHA and
record observed evidence at human checkpoint `wave-acceptance` — do not invent them
here.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Applicable | yes / no — {reason if no} |
| Environment class | local-compose / staging-sandbox / … |
| Mode | smoke \| sandbox |
| Runtime head binding | Bound at `wave-acceptance` against the wave PR head under test (not filled at planning) |
| Prerequisites | |
| Safe test data | |
| Steps / command | `{live_verify_dir}/…` |
| Expected observations | |
| Expected evidence | `wave-accepted on tip` / human wave-acceptance |
| Cleanup | |
| Stop conditions | |

> When the wave FILE list adds/changes a product surface (P15), include ≥1
> `live_verify_dir` FILE in **Files** and a live row here. Agent implements the
> script; human executes it at `wave-acceptance`.

---

### Phase W1 — {title}

**GOAL-W1:** …

| Task | Description | Implements | Depends on | Files (path/action) | Exit criteria | Proof (kind / command\|review) | Expected | Evidence expected | Codebase | Spec path | Verify command | MDC notes | ADR notes | Branch |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| TASK-W1-01 | | REQ-{nn} | — | | | | | | {repo} | {SPEC_PATH} | | | | |

#### Files (W1)

| ID | Path | Action |
|----|------|--------|

#### Tests (W1)

| ID | Layer | Command | Proves |
|----|-------|---------|--------|

#### Verification Coverage (W1)

| REQ / criterion | unit | integration/contract | smoke | sandbox | Notes |
|-----------------|------|----------------------|-------|---------|-------|

#### Live-verification intent (W1)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Applicable | |
| Environment class | |
| Mode | |
| Runtime head binding | Bound at `wave-acceptance` (not planning) |
| Prerequisites | |
| Safe test data | |
| Steps / command | |
| Expected observations | |
| Expected evidence | |
| Cleanup | |
| Stop conditions | |

(Repeat per wave.)

## 6. As-built and docs tasks

> Update these in the **same PR** as the code they describe.

| Task | File | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Create/update per-initiative as-built detail | `docs/specification/as-built/Implementation-Status-{INITIATIVE}.md` | Record this wave's capability/code/test/verify detail — **KEEP**, written once per initiative, never appended to across initiatives |
| Update as-built index row | `docs/specification/as-built/implementation-status.md` | Overwrite this capability's one row in place (current status + pointer to the file above) — never append a new table |
| Ensure live-verify coverage marker | the co-shipped/extended `live_verify_dir` artifact itself | Self-declare `REQ-*` coverage per `../../../references/live-verify-coverage-contract.md`. **Do not** edit `tests/README.md` for this — it is not the source of truth |

> **ADR lifecycle** — Draft and Accepted ADR files are created and accepted during
> `/spec-technical-review` and the `technical-review-approval` checkpoint.
> Planning consumes Accepted files only; do not add ADR promotion tasks here.

## 8. Forge / PR instructions

> Persist this plan locally and publish via `/commit-workspace` (or Gateflow
> ForgeClient) to the **Draft spec PR** branch alongside spec, feasibility,
> and TDD. Do **not** commit inside this skill. Label remains **`spec-pending`**
> until PE completes §10.

```
Branch:   chore/INIT-{COMPONENT}-{NUMBER}-spec-{repo}  (Draft PR)
PR title: "[INIT-{COMPONENT}-{NUMBER}] Spec — {repo}"
PR body:  link meta PRD PR; paste §1 Requirements table + wave goals summary

Required reviewers: @{pe-team}
Review deadline: {date from front matter}

PE checklist (before spec-lgtm):
  [ ] Spec + feasibility + TDD + Accepted ADRs + this plan on current head
  [ ] §0 PE sign-off on TDD marked complete — required, no N/A path (technical review always exists)
  [ ] Wave order and dependencies make sense
  [ ] Done-when / exit criteria are observable and testable (P4)
  [ ] Verification Coverage maps every criterion to a layer (P5)
  [ ] WorkManifest YAML (§9) passes workmanifest-contract-pass (P16) — prayog/v1
  [ ] P1–P16 checks all pass (including P15 co-ship when surface changes)

After spec-lgtm + Approve + merge — **`/create-board-tickets`** from §9 (post-merge only):
  Create one GitHub Issue per wave (W0, W1, …) using §9 titles, bodies, depends_on
  Search for existing initiative/wave issues first; create only missing issues
  Then Pass-1: /pre-implement → /loop-spec → wave-acceptance (human runs co-shipped script)
  Then Pass-2: /learning-extract → /ground-spec → wave-signoff (merge only)
```

## 10. Coding-readiness unlock (PE — after plan on head)

Present this section in chat when the plan is persisted locally and Forge
readiness is filled. **No GitHub side effects** until PE completes the unlock
via authorized Forge / human actions.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Workflow outcome | `{outcome}` — {reason} |
| Verdict | GATE OPEN REQUEST / BLOCKED |
| Spec PR | {URL} |
| Spec PR head SHA | `{SHA}` |
| Gate label (current) | `spec-pending` |
| Gate label (target) | `spec-lgtm` |
| Local plan path | `{reports_dir}/{plan_prefix}-{initiative}.md` |
| Forge readiness | fill `handoff.forge` for `/commit-workspace` — do not commit inside this skill |
| Blocking items | none / {reason} |

Provision labels when missing:

```bash
launchpad apply-gates --repo <name> --apply
```

PE actions (all on **exact current head**):

1. Remove `spec-pending`, `spec-blocked`, `spec-revised`, `spec-stale`; add **`spec-lgtm`**
2. Submit GitHub **Approve** with attestation body (below)
3. Mark Draft PR **Ready for review**
4. Authorize merge (human or policy); then **`/create-board-tickets`** from §9

### Approve attestation body

```text
Spec package approved
initiative: {INIT-id}
spec_pr_head_sha: {SHA}
meta_pr_head_sha: {SHA}
impact_map_revision: {N}
prd_digest: sha256:{hex}
scope_digest: sha256:{hex}
plan_digest: sha256:{hex}
artifacts:
  - docs/specification/product/INIT-{id}.md
  - docs/specification/reports/Initiative-Feasibility-Report-{INIT-id}.md
  - docs/specification/reports/Technical-Review-{INIT-id}.md
  - docs/specification/reports/Implementation-Plan-{INIT-id}.md
```

Never infer approval from `spec-lgtm` alone — Approve, label, and artifact
digests must match the same head SHA.

| PE action | Remove | Add |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Pending/new revision | `spec-lgtm`, `spec-blocked` | `spec-pending` |
| Request changes/hold | `spec-pending`, `spec-lgtm` | `spec-blocked` |
| Approve full package | `spec-pending`, `spec-blocked`, `spec-revised`, `spec-stale` | `spec-lgtm` |

## 9. WorkManifest seed

> **Primary:** `/create-board-tickets` creates **one GitHub Issue per wave** (`W0`, `W1`, …)
> from this section after spec merge. Wave bodies **must list every `TASK-*`**
> with exit criteria for human traceability (TASK sub-issues optional).
>
> Before creation, run `gh auth status` and search existing issues by initiative
> plus wave id. With explicit developer authorization, create only missing
> issues. If `gh` is unavailable, output exact commands and stop.
>
> Wave `id` must be exactly `W0`, `W1`, … — one issue per wave, not per TASK row.
> Each TASK **implements** one or more product `REQ-*` (never invent `REQ-W*`).
> Contract: `../../../references/workmanifest-contract.md` (`prayog/v1`).
> Ids: `../../../references/id-conventions.md`.
> Validate: `python scripts/workmanifest_contract.py` on this plan (P16 /
> `workmanifest-contract-pass`).
> Set `target.org` from governance and `target.project` from
> `governance.project_board.name` (read-only meta). Resolve with
> `launchpad board-bind --client <id>` — do not free-text board names.
>
> Do **not** put board `status`, observed evidence, or runtime head/SHA in this
> approved manifest — those live on the board, Wave-Execution artifacts, and
> human wave-acceptance (`wave-accepted`). Optional/legacy Live-Verify-* is not SSOT.
