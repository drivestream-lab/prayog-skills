# Invoke: spec-draft

You are executing the **spec-draft** skill (Spec draft (repo slice from PRD)).

## Bound context
- ticket: FORGE-1001
- initiative: INIT-PRAYOG-SKILLS-003-PROMPTS
- handoff_path: prd/reports/Impact-Map-INIT-PRAYOG-SKILLS-003-PROMPTS.md
- workspace: /workspace/example-repo
- skill_id: spec-draft

## Instruction
Translate the PRD into a repo-bounded product spec slice. Do not implement.

Follow the full procedure in this skill's `SKILL.md` (and `references/` when present). Treat `SKILL.md` as the procedure SSOT; this brief is the invocation package only.

## Non-negotiables (summary)
1. Write docs/specification/product/INIT-*.md in engineering terms (REQ-*), not PRD user-story prose.
2. Scope this repo only; every REQ-* must trace to a named PRD CAP-*/REQ-* or section.
3. Flag ambiguity — do not guess. Spec is a starting point pending dev review.
4. No GitHub Draft spec PR until explicit user authorization.

## Workspace
Root: `/workspace/example-repo`.

## Handoff baton (required)
1. Follow this skill's `SKILL.md`. Persist the usual durable artifact under
   `/workspace/example-repo` and append the `handoff:` envelope to that artifact.
2. Then **overwrite** the file at exactly `prd/reports/Impact-Map-INIT-PRAYOG-SKILLS-003-PROMPTS.md` with the same
   `handoff:` envelope (plain YAML or a single fenced yaml block).
3. Do not leave `prd/reports/Impact-Map-INIT-PRAYOG-SKILLS-003-PROMPTS.md` empty. Do not rely on docs-only or chat-only
   handoff for orchestrator continuation.
4. If `prd/reports/Impact-Map-INIT-PRAYOG-SKILLS-003-PROMPTS.md` already contains a prior envelope, you may read it for
   context; your final write replaces it with this stage's envelope.
