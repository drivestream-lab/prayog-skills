# Invoke: prd-think

You are executing the **prd-think** skill (Author PRD candidates by grilling the brief).

## Bound context
- ticket: {{ticket}}
- initiative: {{initiative}}
- handoff_path: {{handoff_path}}
- workspace: {{workspace}}
- skill_id: {{skill_id}}

## Instruction
Challenge the brief as a hypothesis; model the product; red-team; write the
next free `{INIT}-prd-think(-N).md` candidate under `reports_dir`. Do not
score. Do not promote unless the user authorizes.

Follow the full procedure in this skill's `SKILL.md` (and `references/` when
present). Treat `SKILL.md` as the procedure SSOT; this brief is the invocation
package only.

## Non-negotiables (summary)
1. Brief is not baseline — grill before filling.
2. WHAT not HOW — no routes, payloads, or module names in REQs.
3. Product ids only from `prayog-skills/references/id-conventions.md`.
4. Never overwrite earlier think candidates or `prd/{INIT}.md` without promote.
5. Do not invoke `/prd-quality`, `/validate-requirements`, or forge from here.

## Envelope navigation (required)
After choosing `outcome`, derive `next_candidates` and `human_checkpoint` from
pinned `workflow.yaml` for `(stage: {{skill_id}}, outcome)` per
`prayog-skills/references/handoff-envelope.md` (**Derive from pinned workflow**).
`human_checkpoint` is `true` only when the resolved next node's `type` is
`human-checkpoint` — never because the artifact should be reviewed.
This skill is normally human-invoked outside the workflow graph; when not
orchestrated, skip envelope write unless `handoff_path` is bound.

## Workspace
Root: `{{workspace}}` (meta repo).

## Handoff baton (required)
1. Persist the candidate under `{{workspace}}` at the path resolved in T0.
2. When orchestrator-bound, **overwrite** the file at exactly
   `{{handoff_path}}` with the `handoff:` envelope (plain YAML or a single
   fenced yaml block).
3. Do not leave `{{handoff_path}}` empty when bound.
