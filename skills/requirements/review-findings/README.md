# review-findings

Interactive workshop for validation / audit reports. **Collect decisions only**
— does not edit the PRD. Writes canonical
`prd/reports/Resolution-{INIT}.md` (overwrite; no `*-revN` siblings).

Findings use stable `VF-*` ids; decisions become `CHG-*` linked to those ids.
See `references/id-conventions.md` and `references/artifact-write-contract.md`.
